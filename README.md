# Fresh Windows Installation

1. Adding an option to the contextual menu to execute ps1 files as administrator and bypassing the execution policy
2. Setting no UAC prompts
3. Installation of my basic software with Chocolatey and Winget

It should be run as administrator and after prepping the system (debloat scripts or anything like that) and installing Chocolatey.

Main just downloads the script and executes it in an administrator session
