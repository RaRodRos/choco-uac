# choco-uac
1. Adding an option to the contextual menu to execute ps1 files as administrator and bypassing the execution policy
2. Installation of my basic software
3. Setting no UAC prompts

It should be run as administrator and after prepping the system (debloat scripts or anything like that) and installing Chocolatey.

Main just downloads the script and executes it in an administrator session
